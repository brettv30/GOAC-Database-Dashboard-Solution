# Great Outdoors Apparel Company Database / Dashboard Solution
For this final project I created Conceptual, Logical, and Physical Dimensional Data Models using the Erwin Data Modeler software. Views of each of these models can be found in the "Documents" folder. Afterwards, a physical database was generated using mySQL, coding all DDL and DML using the mySQL Workbench. All DDL and DML can be found in the "Physical Database" folder. Then, I began going through the ETL process with data from the various CSV files, all of which can be found in the "Data Files" folder. Finally, on top of the fully functional database I created two Tableau Dashboards that can be found in "Tableau Workbooks and Dashboards". To wrap up and summarize everything that was done in this course a PowerPoint and Standard Operating Procedure document has been created, each of these can be found in the "Documents" folder.
