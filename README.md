# Great Outdoors Apparel Company Database / Dashboard Solution
A final project for my Decision Support Systems course during Spring 2021. Here I created Conceptual, Logical, and Physical Dimensional Data Models in Erwin Data Modeler. Afterwards, I generated a physical database in mySQL coding all DDL and DML using the mySQL Workbench. Then, I began going through the ETL process with data from various CSV files (see Data Files). Finally, on top of the fully functional dimensional database I created two Tableau Dashboards.
